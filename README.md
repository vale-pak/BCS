# BCS
#  
# Here you will find the datasets and the code used in the computation the BCS.
# 
# The UMAP_BCS.py code shows how the BCS has been built and the 2017_dataset.gz provides the original meta-analytic maps used to compute the space. 
# Euclidean_BCS.py shows the code used to compute the euclidean distances between the maps.
# Contrast.con and designmat.gz files show the contrast and the design applied to the linear regression that allowed for the prediction of the BCS maps.
# The resulting predicted maps are provided in Predicted_2017_zmaps.gz as z-transformed, thresholded maps.
# The coordinates and rationality index of the maps are provided in the BCS_coordinates.csv file.
