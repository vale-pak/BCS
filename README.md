# BCS
# Welcome to the BCS repository! 
# Here you will find the datasets and the code used in the computation (BCS_creation branch) and validation (New_maps_projection branch) of the BCS.
# Note that python v 3.8, umap.learn v 0.5.1, numba v 0.53.1, and pickle v 0.7.5 are needed to open the BCS and project your data onto it.
